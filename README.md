**Note:** To run "NaiveBayesModel.ipynb", you need preprocessed_data.csv. 
I am having the preprocessed data that is obtain from train.csv and resource.csv. 
These all three .csv files are more than 100 mb each and github don't allow it for free.
So to run this code, please download the preprocessed.csv from keggle.
