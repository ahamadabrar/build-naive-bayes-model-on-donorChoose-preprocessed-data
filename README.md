**Note:** To run "NaiveBayesModel.ipynb", you need preprocessed_data.csv. 
I have the preprocessed_data.csv that is obtained from train.csv and resource.csv. 
All three .csv files are more than 100 MB each and GitHub doesn't allow it for free that's why I did not upload them.
So to run this code, please download the preprocessed.csv from keggle.
